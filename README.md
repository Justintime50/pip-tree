There is no simple, native way to get the dependency tree of a Python virtual environment using the Pip package manager for Python. Pip Tree fixes this problem by retrieving every package from your virtual environment and returning a list of JSON objects that include the package name, version installed, date updated, and which packages are required by each package (the tree).

## Install

```bash
# Install Pip Tree globally
pip3 install pip-tree

# Install Pip Tree into the virtual environment of the project you want to run it on
venv/bin/pip install pip-tree

# Install locally
make install
```

## Usage

```text
Virtual Env Usage:
    pip-tree

Global Usage:
    pip-tree --path "path/to/my_project/venv/lib/python3.9/site-packages"

Options:
    -h, --help            show this help message and exit
    -p PATH, --path PATH  The path to the site-packages directory of a Python virtual environment. If a path is not provided, the virtual environment Pip Tree is run from will be used.
```

### Package

In addition to the CLI tool, you can use functions to retrieve the list of packages and their details from a Python virtual environment in your own code:

```python
import pip_tree

path = 'path/to/my_project/venv/lib/python3.9/site-packages'

package_list = pip_tree.get_pip_package_list(path)
for package in package_list:
    package_details = pip_tree.get_package_details(package)
    print(package_details['name'])
```

## Development

```bash
# Get a comprehensive list of development tools
make help
```
